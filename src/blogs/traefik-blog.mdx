I just spent the last couple of hours configuring Traefik to work the way I want it to work. Now that's not a massive achievement, but for someone who has repeatedly put this off - its a big deal!

## TL;DR
- PiHole running on a Raspberry Pi in a Docker container
- Proxmox running on a random enterprise computer i found on ebay
- Traefik running as an LXC container on Proxmox
- SSL working with cloudflare and letsencrypt


## Creating my Pihole
Setting up the PiHole was easy.

As I had a bunch of crap on the pi, I did a fresh install of PiOS.
I did have to purchase a microSD card USB-C reader thing off of amazon, which delayed my setup by a couple of days.
I also have a dhcp binding on my router, so I linked the mac address of the pi to a static IP - which made it easy to know where to ssh

So:
- flashed PiOS to the SD card
- booted up the pi
- disabled the wifi, enabled internet, and switched off the desktop: `sudo raspi-config`
- ssh into that sucker (ssh rafee@pi.local)
- installed docker a la [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/)
- create a docker compose file with pihole (TODO: upload file to git)
- forward dns to the pihole on my router

## Creating Proxmox
Again, setting up Proxmox was easy.
I bought a dell prodesk for like £200 that came with 500gb nvme ssd, 32gb ram, and an i5 processor. Maybe I got ripped off, but I was happy with it.
Also bought a renewed 2tb hdd from amazon warehouse for like £50

- flash the iso to a USB using [balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
- plug that sucker into the computer
- go through the setup
- navigate to web GUI

### I love LXC
I should have been using these the first time I setup my homelab. Hot damn they are good.

I found this [project](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/) that just has a bunch of scripts to install stuff.
currently running:
- homebridge
- traefik

and they are both working great!

## pihole + traefik
Now here comes the juicy part.

Once you have spun up the traefik LXC, we need to do some tweaking in __pihole__ to get everything working right.
1. go to pihole local dns
1. create a local DNS record to point `traefik.home.rafee.cloud` to the traefik LXC IP (in this case, it was 192.168.1.151)
1. create a CNAME record to point `pihole.home.rafee.cloud` to `traefik.home.rafee.cloud` (this was a little trick I read about so if the traefik LXC ip changes, I only have to change it in one place)

since we are using a prebuilt traefik container, we need to do some tweaking to get it to work with pihole. I used the shell from proxmox to do all this work in the traefik LXC.
The main file we really care about is the `traefik.yml` file. This is where we define the entrypoints, middlewares, and routers for traefik.
This is in the `/etc/traefik/traefik.yml` file.

this is what my file looks like:
```yml
providers:
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik/conf.d/
    watch: true

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ':80'
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: websecure
          scheme: https
  websecure:
    address: ':443'
    http:
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
  traefik:
    address: ':8080'

certificatesResolvers:
  letsencrypt:
    acme:
      email: "<my email>"
      storage: /etc/traefik/ssl/acme.json
      dnsChallenge:
        provider: cloudflare
        resolvers:
          - "1.1.1.1:53"
          - "8.8.8.8:53"
        delayBeforeCheck: 0

api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: true

log:
  filePath: /var/log/traefik/traefik.log
  format: json
  level: INFO

accessLog:
  filePath: /var/log/traefik/traefik-access.log
  format: json
  filters:
    statusCodes:
      - "200"
      - "400-599"
    retryAttempts: true
    minDuration: "10ms"
  bufferingSize: 0
  fields:
    headers:
      defaultMode: drop
      names:
        User-Agent: keep
```

This sets up a folder to watch for changes in the `conf.d` folder, and then sets up the entrypoints for traefik.
In this case, I have a few files in the `conf.d` folder that define the routers and middlewares for my services.
```bash
root@traefik:/etc/traefik/conf.d# ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec 13 17:03 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec 13 17:17 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  303 Dec 13 17:02 homebridge.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  547 Dec 13 17:03 pihole.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  588 Dec 13 14:36 proxmox.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  668 Dec 13 17:03 traefik.yml
```

## pihole.yml
This is what my pihole.yml file looks like:
```bash
root@traefik:/etc/traefik/conf.d# cat pihole.yml
http:
  middlewares:
    addAdmin:
      redirectRegex:
        regex: "^https?://pihole.home.rafee.cloud/$"
        replacement: "http://pihole.home.rafee.cloud/admin/"

  routers:
    pihole:
      rule: "Host(`pihole.home.rafee.cloud`)"
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      service: pihole
      middlewares:
        - addAdmin  # Apply the middleware
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt

  services:
    pihole:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://192.168.1.104"  # Pointing to your Pi-hole instance
```

## Done
With all this setup done, you should be able to visit `pihole.home.rafee.cloud` and see your pihole dashboard.
I am loving this setup.



### IMPORTANT PLEASE READ FUTURE ME
You are using cloudflare as your dns challenge, you need to create a token in cloudflare to do this.
This video helped me, by [Chistian Lempa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hfejNXqOzA)

For some reason, you also had issues with the cloud flare token, so you had to edit the traefik process. This is what you did:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/traefik.service
```
and then you updated the file to look like this:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Traefik is an open-source Edge Router that makes publishing your services a fu>

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/bin/traefik --configFile=/etc/traefik/traefik.yaml
Restart=on-failure
ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR1 $MAINPID
Environment="CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=<token goes here>"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
