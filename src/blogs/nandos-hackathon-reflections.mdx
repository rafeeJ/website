This month, the Nando's tech team hosted their second(?) ever hackathon. This was my first with the company, and I was super excited to get involved - those who know me will know that hackathons are my jam.

The theme for the hackathon was "Running Restaurants Brilliantly" - a broad theme that aligned with Nando's mission to create a better experience for the staff in our restaurants.

I wanted to write this post to reflect on the hackathon: what went well, what didn't, and the expected end result for developers and the company.

## What is a hackathon?
Let's return to the basics for a mo: a hackathon is a time-boxed event where developers come together to create a working prototype for a pre-defined problem.

The idea is to encourage creativity, collaboration, and innovation. It's a great way to get developers out of their comfort zone and working on something new.

## Why do companies run hackathons?
There have been lots of great products that have been born out of hackathons. For example, Facebook's "Like" button was created during a hackathon.

It's a great way to get developers to innovate and think outside the box. It's also a great way to get developers to work on something new and exciting.
This in turn boosts morale and can lead to new teams being spun up to further develop the ideas.


## What was the Nando's hackathon like
The hack was a two-day event earlier in March '24, held in the head office in London.

As someone who has only participated in either virtual hacks or those held in a large company, this was a major change of pace.

The event felt smaller and more focused - there were around 6 teams participating. Team sizes varied from 2 to 10 people.


TL;DR:
1. Working with new people on new tech felt great
1.
